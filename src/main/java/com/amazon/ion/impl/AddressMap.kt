/**
 *
 * It occurred to me that there is not only a computational cost to having boxed integers,
 * but there is also a memory costâ€”instead of having a 4 byte integer, a boxed integer requires
 * a 4 byte reference to a 16 byte object.
 *
 * Symbol tables are in the hot-ish path for the reader and writer, so even a small improvement could help.
 *
 * This is modelled after [HashMap], but by adding several constraints, we're
 * able to make certain specialized optimizations.
 *
 * Assumptions/Constraints:
 *  - The map values are integers that are sequentially assigned to values as they get added.
 *  - It is no need to remove a single value. Instead, you must clear the whole map.
 *  - We don't need to expose entry sets.
 *  - A key cannot be null
 *  - A key can have multiple values, but we don't need to access all of them.
 *
 * How is it different from a regular map?
 *  - It preserves insertion order, but without the use of a linked list
 *  - The value is the primitive int, rather than needing to be a boxed int.
 *  - We don't need any remove methods. The only thing we have is "clear".
 *  - The Nodes are pooled so that we don't have to reallocate after calling clear.
 *  - It has O(1) lookup by both key and value
 *  - It's sort of a multimap. A key can have multiple values. However, you
 *    can only find all the values for a key by iterating the entry set.
